TestGiver
=========
To create a test:
1) Create a file called "testquestions.txt"
2) Format the file as follows

  question 1
  //
  choice 1
  choice 2
  .
  .
  .
  //
  correct choice (A-last choice)
  question 2
  .
  .
  .
  (continue as done for question 1)
  
3) The program is very flexible so it will allow you to have a question that is multiple lines. Just press enter! 
  It will also allow you to have as many choices as you want so you can have choices running from A-Z if you would like
Make sure to seperate the question from the choice with a double slash (//) and skip lines as shown above. 

Once the questions are set up you can run the program in the console. Will add a user interface in the future.

An app that tests a student using provided questions and choices
